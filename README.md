# Overview

Crypto PiPs is an attempt to create a general crypto currency wallet that contains wallet addresses for the different types of crypto currency assets on the Ethereum network       .  There are crypto wallets that supports the main stream crypto like ETH and Bitcoin.  This wallet is meant to support other non-mainstream crypto.  It's called "Crypto PiPs" because the initial thought is to own any crypto currency considered to be stable coins.

The second screen below will list out all crypto assets being traded.  Similar to a market dashboard.  This will also require more thoughts.  This may require a page scrape or an interface with an API with places like Coinbase or Binance
